All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [v1.83.0] - 2026-06-19

This release adds an opt-in sudo askpass flow for shell commands, a headless embedded chat session API, and several bug fixes for cost accounting, session handling, and custom provider model resolution.

## What's New

- Adds opt-in `sudo_askpass: true` flag to the `shell` toolset, bridging `sudo` password prompts to the agent's elicitation flow instead of hanging until timeout
- Adds `pkg/embeddedchat`, a headless chat session API for embedding docker-agent runtime conversations in non-docker-agent UIs, with support for streaming events, tool call confirmation, conversation restart, and cancellation
- Makes OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Amazon Bedrock providers optional via build tags, allowing embedders to drop unneeded providers and reduce binary size

## Improvements

- Replaces the bleve full-text search library with a lightweight pure-Go BM25 matcher for model routing, removing a large transitive dependency tree and enabling WebAssembly cross-compilation

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes duplicate `tool_result` blocks for the same `tool_call_id` being passed to strict providers such as AWS Bedrock
- Fixes custom providers (defined with `base_url` + `token_key`) triggering a blocking fetch of the full models.dev catalog (~3.4 MB) on every turn in internet-restricted environments
- Fixes reasoning tokens from streaming usage not being recorded for Anthropic extended-thinking models
- Fixes `run_background_agent` sub-sessions not being persisted to the store
- Adds a warning when an uncatalogued model bills $0 with token usage
- Fixes the Shift+Tab thinking-level cycle in the TUI not offering the `max` effort tier on Claude models that support it (Opus 4.7/4.8, Sonnet 4.6, Fable 5)

## Technical Changes

- Replaces external `go-memoize` and `go-cache` libraries with a new internal `pkg/memoize` package built on `golang.org/x/sync/singleflight`
- Makes the RAG toolset opt-in to remove the cgo dependency on go-tree-sitter from the default build
- Documents YAML anchors, aliases, and merge keys support in the configuration overview
- Documents the 10-second per-toolset tool-listing timeout for wedged MCP servers in the troubleshooting guide

## [v1.82.0] - 2026-06-18

This release adds visual pause state indicators to the TUI, expands MCP catalog and OAuth support, and fixes several runtime, provider, and memory issues.

## What's New

- Adds a banner to the lean TUI on startup
- Adds Grafana Cloud as a remote streamable-http MCP server to the catalog (monitoring category, OAuth 2.1 authentication)
- Adds pausing/paused visual state indicators to the TUI when the `/pause` command is active

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes reserved character sanitization in the memory toolset's default-path config segment, preventing initialization failures on Windows when agents are loaded from OCI references containing `:` in the image tag
- Fixes sub-session transcript not being persisted when the run loop exits via an error path in `runForwarding`
- Fixes sub-session transcript not being persisted on error path in `runCollecting` (background agent path)
- Fixes startup tool listing hanging indefinitely when a toolset's `Tools()` call blocks; adds a per-toolset timeout so the sidebar no longer gets stuck on "Loading tools..."
- Exempts `list_background_agents` from the runtime loop-killer, which previously flagged it as a repeated identical call
- Fixes `delta.reasoning` field being dropped in the OpenAI-compatible chat-completions stream adapter, resolving silent/empty responses with Qwen3 thinking mode
- Fixes configured headers not being forwarded to OAuth discovery requests for remote MCP servers, resolving repeated auth prompts for servers like Grafana Cloud that require instance-scoping headers
- Fixes OAuth default port normalization in MCP header host scoping

## [v1.73.0] - 2026-06-03

This release improves MCP catalog server management, fixes streaming issues with AI providers, and adds memory protection for file search operations.

## What's New

- Adds `--json` flag to `alias list` command for structured output
- Adds ContextLimit helper to modelinfo for centralized context window handling
- Blocks `enable_remote_mcp_server` until the server is actually connected, eliminating the need to re-ask questions

## Improvements

- Removes command queueing - commands are now sent immediately
- Removes empty query truncation from MCP server search, showing all matching servers
- Restricts MCP catalog to OAuth and anonymous-access servers only, removing API key complexity

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes Gemini parallel tool responses by coalescing them into a single Content
- Fixes custom OpenAI provider routing for Responses-only models (gpt-4.1, o-series, gpt-5, Codex)
- Fixes memory explosion in `search_files_content` by capping output at 1 MiB and skipping large files
- Fixes MCP catalog retry logic for existing unstarted entries
- Fixes rollback behavior when MCP server Start is cancelled during OAuth or Tools operations
- Fixes conversation caching to exclude failed chat continuations

## Technical Changes

- Refactors registry operations to reuse single session across digest and pull operations
- Updates OpenAI handler to support newer Responses stream event shapes
- Uses `cmd.Context()` instead of `context.Background()` for proper cancellation support
- Uses `strings.Builder` for message merging to reduce memory allocations
- Improves search_files_content memory handling for symlinks and device files

## [v1.54.0] - 2026-04-29

This release introduces clickable terminal links, domain filtering for fetch operations, and enhanced toolset lifecycle management with configurable supervision profiles.

## What's New

- Makes markdown links and URLs clickable in the terminal using OSC 8 hyperlink escape sequences
- Adds `allowed_domains` and `blocked_domains` filters to the fetch toolset for restricting network access
- Adds `/toolsets` command and supervisor-aware status surface in the TUI
- Introduces `redact_secrets` agent flag that scrubs credential patterns from tool calls and LLM messages

- Introduces `/toolset-restart` slash command for hot-reload functionality

## Improvements

- Defers OAuth elicitation outside interactive context to prevent premature prompts
- Reduces macOS keychain prompts by storing all MCP OAuth tokens in a single keychain item
- Makes every dialog close on ctrl+c, with twice exiting the application
- Filters LSP tools by server-advertised capabilities
- Detects secrets embedded inside larger tokens, not just word-bounded patterns

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes MCP catalog reference in mcp-definitions.yaml from `docker:github` to `docker:github-official`
- Fixes Slack token responses and surfaces server errors in MCP OAuth handling
- Fixes config package names for v6 and v7 versions
- Fixes strip transform reading wrong model in alloy/per-tool override mode
- Suppresses spurious 'is now available' MCP toolset notice after OAuth completion

## Technical Changes
